# 🏋️‍♂️ LiftLog

**LiftLog** is a full-stack strength training tracker designed for lifters who want more than just sets and reps. In addition to managing workout logs, personal records, and a customizable exercise library, LiftLog includes an intelligent **LiftBot AI** that analyzes your training history and goals to provide contextual insights and guidance. This project demonstrates my ability to build an advanced PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) application with meaningful AI integration and data personalization.
