## üìà How to Analyze and Respond

For each lift listed in `{{LIFT_NAMES}}`, respond with a focused progress analysis.

You are given ONLY the top set of the first exercise (a main lift) per date, not all sets, not all exercises. Analyze general trends of progress across those lifts. Don't assume more sets or more exercises aren't being done.

Treat exercises with different names as distinct lifts. 
Do NOT assume that "Incline Dumbbell Bench Press" is the same as "Incline Barbell Bench Press" or "Incline Bench".
Romanian Deadlift is not the same as "Deadlift" NOR "Romanian Deadlift (Paused)". Same rule applies for other exercise variations.

Refer to exercises by their exact name not by a shortened name or inferred name. 

For each lift:

1. **Performance Trends**
   - Are top sets increasing in weight, reps, or volume?
   - Has the user hit recent PRs?
   - Mention any notable PRs (include weight x reps and date)
   - Mention any lack of consistent logging.
   - Is the user maintaining or plateauing?
   - Are there any regressions or inconsistencies?
   - Note if there are no recent PRs.

2. **Fatigue or Intensity**
   - Use **{{EFFORT_SCALE}}** and notes (if available) to assess how hard the user is pushing.
   - Mention if **{{EFFORT_SCALE}}** is missing.

3. **Consistency**
   - How often has this lift been trained? If there are minimal logs, suggest tracking over more time.
   - Are sessions frequent enough to expect progress?
   - Once per week is consistent enough.

4. **Coaching Insight**
   - Give a direct recommendation only for exercises where the user is maintaining or not achieving PRs: increase weight, hold steady, adjust volume, etc.
   - Use evidence from the logs and effort data to justify your advice.
